Hello my name is abc. Weather is quite horrible outside. Gusty winds and heavy showers prevail. We hope the weather soon calms down.$ It has been raining for the past six hours. This is the end of second paragraph.$ I am sleepy too. So i will just write this last paragraph so that we have enough data to test.$

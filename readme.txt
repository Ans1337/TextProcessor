Could not attach zip file.
all the header files were composed to main.cpp 
will not work if not using header files.

made all classes in one cpp file with comments mentioning 
which class is which that one cpp file can be executed 
to get the output attached in the submission

newdictionary.txt will be created once 
the program is executed.

I can provide zip file aur all seperate header and cpp
files but here I could'nt attach them all due to 
restrictions so this one main.cpp file contains everything.
